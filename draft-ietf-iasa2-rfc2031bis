<workgroup>IETF Administrative Support Activity 2</workgroup>

<abstract>
	<t>This document summarises the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - Internet Society (ISOC) 
		relationship, following a major revision to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support 
		Activity (IASA) in 2018. The IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by 
		the IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal, and financial structure. As 
		a result, it also changed the relationship between the IETF and ISOC.

<section title="Introduction">
	
	<t>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that is responsible for the development 
		and maintenance of the Internet Standards. The IETF is primarily a volunteer organization. 
		The driving force is dedicated, high quality engineers from all over the world. In a structure 
		of working groups, these engineers exchange ideas and experience, and through discussion and 
		collaboration (both by electronic and face-to-face) they strive to achieve rough consensus and 
		implement the standards through running code.</t>
	
	<t>The growth of the Internet over several decades has also led to a growth of the IETF. More people, 
		organizations, and companies rely on Internet Standards with every new day. Non-technical issues, 
		such as legal, administrative, and financial issues have long been an undesirable but unavoidable 
		part of the IETF. To address these issues the IETF initially established the Poised95 Working Group 
		in 1995 to structure and document the IETF processes in such a way as to maximize the flexibility 
		and freedom of the engineers in the IETF so that they can work in the way the IETF has always 
		been most successful, and to honour the IETF credo: "Rough consensus and running code".</t>
	
	<t>The Poised95 Working Group concluded that the Internet Society (ISOC), which was formed in 1992, was 
		the best organization to handle all of these legal, administrative, and financial tasks on behalf 
		of and in close cooperation with the IETF. This led to the creation of a series of documents, such as 
		The IETF Standards Process, The IETF organizational structure, The IETF charter, The Nomcom procedures, 
		The Appeals procedures, and so on. [REFERENCES NEEDED]</t>
	
	<t>As time passed and operational experience accumulated, additional structure was necessary. As a result, 
		documents were written in order to more fully define what was called the Internet Administrative 
		Support Activity (IASA) in 2005. The key documents supporting the initial definition of the IASA 
		were <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/>.</t>

 	<t>In 2018, the IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the IASA2 Working Group. This made 
		signifincant revisions to the IETF's administrative, legal, and financial structure. One critical 
		outcome was that the IETF formed the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC), 
		in close cooperation with ISOC.</t>
	
	<t>As a result, the IASA 2.0 structure and formation of the IETF LLC have changed the relationship 
		between the IETF and ISOC. This document summarises the current state of the IETF - ISOC  
		relationship at a high level and replaces <xref target="FRC2031"/>.</t>

<section anchor="boundary" title="Main boundary condition">
      
      <t>The IETF remains responsible for the development and quality of the
   Internet Standards. The ISOC will aid the IETF by facilitating legal
   and organizational issues as described below. Apart from the roles
   described below, the IETF and ISOC acknowledge that the ISOC has no
   influence whatsoever on the Internet Standards process, the Internet
	      Standards or their technical content.</t>

   <t>All subgroups in the IETF and ISOC that have an official role in the
   standards process should be either:
   - open to anyone (like Working Groups); or
   - have a well documented restricted membership in which the
	   voting members are elected or nominated through an open process.</t>

  <t> The latter means that within the IETF the IAB and the IESG need to be
   formed through a nomination process that is acceptable to the IETF
   community and that gives all IETF participants an equal chance to be
   candidate for a position in either of these bodies. For the ISOC this
   means that the Board of Trustees should be elected by the ISOC
   individual membership, where all individual members have an equal
   vote and all individual members have an equal opportunity to stand as
	  a candidate for a position on the Board of Trustees.</t>
	    
	    <t>ISOC will, like the IETF use public discussion and consensus building
   processes when it wants to develop new policies or regulations that
   may influence the role of ISOC in the Internet or the Internet
   Technical work. ISOC will always put work related to Internet
   standards, Internet technical issues or Internet operations up for
   discussion in the IETF through the IETF Internet-drafts publication
   process.</t>

<section anchor="legal" title="The legal umbrella">

      <t>To avoid the fact that the IETF has to construct its own legal
   structure to protect the standards and the standards process, ISOC
   should provide a legal umbrella. The legal umbrella will at least
	      cover:</t>
  <t> - legal insurance for all IETF officers (IAB, IESG, Nomcom and WG
	  chairs);</t>
  <t> - legal protection of the RFC series of documents; In such a way
     that these documents can be freely (i.e. no restrictions
     financially or otherwise) distributed, copied etc. but cannot
     be altered or misused. And that the right to change the document
	  lies with the IETF.</t>
   <t>- legal protection in case of Intellectual property rights disputes
     over Internet Standards or parts thereof.</t>

    </section>
	  
	  <section anchor="standards" title="The standards process role">

		  <t>ISOC will assist the standards process by</t>
     <t>- appointing the nomcom chair</t>
     <t>- approving IAB candidates</t>
     <t>- reviewing and approving the documents that describe the standards
       process (i.e. the formal Poised documents).</t>
     <t>- acting as the last resort in the appeals process</t>

    </section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>By involving ISOC into specific parts of the Standards process, the
   IETF has no longer absolute control. It can be argued that this is a
   breach of security. It is therefore necessary to make sure that the
   ISOC involvement is restricted to well defined and understood parts,
   at well defined and understood boundary conditions. The Poised WG
   attempts to define these, and they are summarised in this document.</t>
	      
	<t>      There are three alternatives:</t>

   <t>- Do nothing and ignore the increasing responsibility and growth; the
     risk here is that the IETF either becomes insignificant, or will be
     suffocated by US law suits.</t>
	      
	<t>         - The IETF does everything itself; this keeps the IETf in control,
     but it would distract enormously from the technical work the IETF
     is trying to get done.</t>

  <t> - The IETF finds another organization than ISOC to take on the role
     described above. But why would another organization be better than
     ISOC?</t>

  <t> All in all a certain risk seems unavoidable, and a relationship with
   ISOC, under the restrictions and boundary conditions as have been
   described above, seems more like an opportunity for the IETF than
   like a risk.</t>
