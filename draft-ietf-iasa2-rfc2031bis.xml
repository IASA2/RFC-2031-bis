<workgroup>IETF Administrative Support Activity 2</workgroup>

<abstract>
  <t>
This document summarises the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) -
Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to
the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in
2018. The IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the
IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal,
and financial structure. As a result, it also changed the relationship
between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise RFC 2031.

<section title="Introduction and History">
  <t>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that is
responsible for the development and maintenance of the Internet
Standards. The IETF is primarily a volunteer organization. Its driving
force is a group of dedicated high-quality engineers from all over the
world. In a structure of working groups, these engineers exchange
ideas and experience, and through discussion and collaboration (both
electronically and face-to-face) they strive to achieve rough
consensus and implement the standards through running code.
  </t>
	
  <t>
The growth of the Internet over several decades also led to the
growth of the IETF. More and more people, organizations, and companies
rely on Internet Standards. Non-technical issues, such as legal,
administrative, and financial issues had long been an undesirable but
unavoidable part of the IETF. To address these issues in 1995 the IETF
established the Poised95 Working Group. Its goal was to structure and
document the IETF processes in order to maximize the flexibility and
freedom of IETF engineers so that they could work in the way the IETF
had always been most successful and to honour the IETF credo: "Rough
consensus and running code".
  </t>
	
  <t>
The Poised95 Working Group concluded that the Internet Society (ISOC),
which was formed in 1992, was the best organization to handle all of
these legal, administrative, and financial tasks on behalf of and in
close cooperation with the IETF. This led to documenting things such
as the IETF standards process <xref target="RFC2026"/>, the IETF
organizational structure <xref target="RFC2028"/>, the IETF Nominating
Committee (NomCom) procedures <xref target="RFC2282"/>, and the IETF-ISOC
relationship <xref target="RFC2031"/>.
  </t>
	
  <t>
As time passed and operational experience accumulated, additional
structure was necessary. As a result, the Internet Administrative
Support Activity (IASA) was defined in 2005 and documented in <xref
target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
In 2018, the IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the
IASA2 Working Group, which made signifincant revisions to the IETF's
administrative, legal, and financial structure. One critical outcome
was that the formation, in close cooperation between the IETF and
ISOC, of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC)
as a subsidiary of ISOC.
  </t>
	
  <t>
As a result of the the IASA 2.0 structure <xref
target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-struct"/> and formation of the IETF LLC, the
relationship between the IETF and ISOC has changed. This document
summarises the current state of the IETF - ISOC relationship at a high
level and replaces <xref target="RFC2031"/>.
  </t>
	
</section>
    	
<section title="Main Division of Responsibilities between IETF and ISOC">
      
  <t>
The IETF remains responsible for the development and quality of the
Internet Standards. The Internet Society will aid the IETF by
facilitating legal and organizational issues as described below. Apart
from the roles described below, the IETF and ISOC acknowledge that
ISOC has no influence whatsoever on the technical content of Internet
Standards.
  </t>

    </section>

	
<section title="Philosophical Relationship with ISOC">

  <t>
ISOC and the IETF have historically been philosophically
aligned. ISOC's connection with the IETF community has always played
an important role in its policy work. ISOC has always been an advocate
for multistakeholder processes, which include the technical
community. Open standards are an explicit part of one of the focus
areas in ISOC's mission: Advancing the development and application of
Internet infrastructure, technologies, and open standards.
   </t>

</section>
    
<section anchor="standards" title="ISOC's Role in the IETF Standards Process">

  <t>
ISOC plays a small role in the IETF standards process. In particular,
ISOC assists the standards process by appointing the IETF NomCom chair
and by confirming IAB candidates who are put forward by the IETF
NomCom, as described in <xref target="RFC7437"/>, and by acting as the
last resort in the appeals process, as describes in <xref
target="RFC2026"/>.
  </t>
  
</section>

<section title="The IETF's Role in ISOC">

  <t>
The IETF plays a role in the governance of ISOC. Per ISOC's by-laws,
the IETF appoints a set of trustees to the ISOC Board. The process by
which the IETF makes those appointments is defined in <xref
target="RFC3677"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
The charter of the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) <xref
target="RFC2850"/> states that "the IAB acts as a source of advice and
guidance to the Board of Trustees and Officers of the Internet Society
concerning technical, architectural, procedural, and (where
appropriate) policy matters pertaining to the Internet and its
enabling technologies". This connection between the IAB and ISOC
ensures that ISOC's proposals in the policy area are based on a sound
understanding of the relevant technologies and architectures. ISOC's
strong connection to the Internet technical community has always been
one of its main strengths.
  </t>

</section>


<section title="Legal Relationship with ISOC">

  <t>
The IETF LLC was created as a subsidiary of ISOC.  For tax purposes it
is treated as part of ISOC, but it is managed separately. ISOC
operates as a U.S. 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and was
founded to support and promote the development of the Internet as a
global technical infrastructure, a resource to enrich people's lives,
and a force for good in society. The Limited Liability Company
Agreement of IETF Administration LLC, dated August 27 2018, is the
Operating Agreement that governs the relationship between the IETF LLC
and ISOC.
  </t>
	
  <t>
The IETF LLC provides the IETF with a separate legal existence. The
IETF LLC structure now covers the IETF standards and IETF standards
process, all IETF officers (IAB, IESG, Nomcom, and WG chairs), IETF
employees and contractors, the RFC series and RFC editor, and all of
the IETF's other business operations.
  </t>
	
  <t>
The IETF Trust, documented in <xref target="RFC5378"/>, and updated in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-rationale"/> and <xref
target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update"/>, provides legal protection for
the RFC series of documents and other aspects of the IETF. This
includes things such as protection for trademarks, copyrights, and
intellectual property rights. As part of the IETF Trust arrangement,
IETF standards documents can be freely downloaded, copied, and
distributed without financial or other distribution restrictions,
though all rights to change these documents lie with the IETF.  The
IETF Trust also provides legal protection in case of disputes over
intellectual property rights and other rights. The creation of the
IETF LLC has changed the way that the Trust's trustees are selected
but did not change the purpose or operation of the Trust.
  </t>

</section>

<section title="Financial and Administrative Relationship with ISOC">
	
  <t>
Under the terms of the Operating Agreement between ISOC and the IETF,
ISOC has agreed to provide some funding support for the IETF (ISOC has
historically provided the IETF with significant financial support).
In particular, among other things, the IETF LLC will be responsible
for creating and managing an annual operating budget for the IETF; for
negotiating, signing, and overseeing contracts; for fund raising; for
maintaining a bank account; and for liability insurance. The IETF LLC
is managed by a board of directors, one of whom is appointed by
ISOC. The intention is that ISOC and the IETF LLC operate at arms
length.
  </t>  
  <t>
Under the new IASA 2.0 structure, the IETF is solely responsible for
its administration via the IETF LLC, IETF Trust, IAB, IESG, IETF
working groups, and other IETF processes. A further exploration of
this can be found in Section 4 of <xref
target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-struct"/>.
